# STM32CubeCanTx
Derivation of CAN Tx for CTM32F103 using STMCube MX.

Test derivation, this sets up the peripherals ok but there's a bit of a leap to then get it to do anything.  I think using examples is better.

i.e port MX example into code then use this just to tailor the IO config as required.
