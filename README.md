# STM32CubeCanTx
Derivation of CAN Tx for CTM32F103 using STMCube MX using Atollic and STM32F103C8T6 board and SWD.

Test derivation, this sets up the peripherals ok but there's a big leap to then get it to do anything.  I think using examples is better then just use this as a ref to set the pins up.

Left in an working state.
